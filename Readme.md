# Github Commit Fetcher with github actions(ci/cd)

##
This is a simple github commit fetcher where I have used a public repository named **moodle** a well know LMS. Here I have added a bash script to fetch some latest commits from moodle's 405 stable branch. I have also created a docker file to build and run in docker. I have also used github actions that will automatically build and upload the docker image in your personal docker hub account.
